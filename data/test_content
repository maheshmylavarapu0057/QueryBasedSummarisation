<s> everyone has the right to enter whatever consensual relationships they choose but no one has the right to have the government recognize and grant special benefits to them merely because of that relationship . thus the law can not recognize `` gay marriage '' `` straight marriage '' and `` bisexual marriage '' as distinct rights . if it did then there would be no equality amongst them because gays would not have `` straight marriage rights '' bisexuals would not have `` gay marriage rights '' etc . further being unmarried is just as much a right as being married yet the law should not create `` unmarried rights '' . <eos>
<s> - this debate often assumes that driver 's licenses would simply be offered to illegal mexican immigrants with the claim that the us economy is dependent on these `` productive '' illegal immigrants . but what about other groups of illegal immigrants that may be `` less desirable '' ? what about an illegal immigrant from for example iran ? the problem is that the proposition tends to base its arguments off of only one particular group of illegal immigrants ( mexican immigrants constituted around 57 % of the illegal immigrant population in 2007 [ 1 ] ) while seemingly denying the costs of accepting other groups of illegal immigrants into this program . <eos>

<s> the caucasus is very unstable with some of its nations looking to turkey for support for religious and cultural reasons . a middle eastern border would involve the eu in the israeli-arab conflict and give it a border with an aggressive and unstable iraq ( and iran ) with whom it would share an assertive kurdish minority seeking statehood . turkey even has major disputes with greece a current eu member over territory in the aegean and over the divided island of cyprus where it alone recognises and backs the turkish republic of north cyprus preventing a settlement .

<s> the credibility of the commitment of article v of the nato charter in which every member pledges to come to the defence of another has already been undermined by the inclusion of hungary poland and the czech republic . nato runs the grave risk of becoming so large and diverse it resembles a political organisation rather than a military alliance . the military contribution of the new members would be by definition limited . were these republics already capable of providing sufficient security to their borders there would be no necessity for nato membership . at the point where the nato commitments become more declaratory than real the security of every state including the new members is called into question . thus nato expansion might <eos>
<s> kyoto protocol exempted developing countries such as china from meeting certain key emissions standards . the problem is that the new emissions from china would offset all emissions cuts from developed nations . as a result the world under kyoto protocol would/will emit roughly the same amount and make little progress to cutting emissions overall . this is unacceptable . developed countries can not be expected to lead on climate change under such circumstances . they are forced into a situation in which they must ask `` what 's the point ?

<s> `` fair use '' involves drawing a line in the sand between what is fair use of copyrighted content and what is not . the problem is that defining this line is as much art as anything else . the context of the use matters greatly such as whether the user intends to use the content for commercial and non-commercial purposes . the problem is that the flexibility of the definition causes many copyright holders to sue even if their case is not too strong . this is expensive for all parties involved and ultimately more costly overall than it is worth . <eos>
